# Colormaps


## Some Science

Colour can be defined by two things:

- luminosity ()
- hue or tint (the 'colour')

In the eye these are processed by different cells:

- rod cells process achromaticity (greyscale)
- cone cells process hue
  - 2/3 of cells process longer wavelengths giving better perception across warmer colors
  - colour vision deficiency is usually an abnornality in one or more types of cone cell
  - The most common CVD is red-green dichromatism (M-cone cell)


## Interpretability and colourblindness

Consider types of colormap in terms of luminosity:

- Uniform
- Sequential
- Cyclic

## Scientific danger

The larger danger is that by using 'artificial' colourmaps information is not seen, or worse
misinterpreted due to artifacts.

## Improving data visualisation

- Try a few colormaps when plotting

- Sometimes we need to stretch/compress regions of the colormap to suit our data
